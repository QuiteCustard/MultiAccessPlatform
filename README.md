# MultiAccessPlatform

This was a project I created in my second year of university. My assignment was to create a CPD and training enrolment system.

## Features
- The platform has three levels of access (user, admin and owner)
- Admins/Owners are able to manage staff user accounts (Add, remove, edit and list all users)
- Admins/Owners are able to add, remove and edit courses that are being offered.
- Users are able to view a list of the courses available, with access to full course details
- Users are able to select and enrol onto courses
- Users are able to view the courses they are currently enrolled and remove their booking if necessary
- Ability to track number of enrolled users onto each course for users and administrators/owners (e.g. “3 of 10 spaces booked”)
- Users are blocked from enrolling onto a course that is full
- Owner accounts cannot be deleted by admins
